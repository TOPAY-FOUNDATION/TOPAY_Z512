# GitHub Actions Documentation Workflow Fixes

## Issue Summary

The documentation generation workflow was failing with error:

```output
Error: Action failed with "The process '/usr/bin/git' failed with exit code 128"
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Conflicting GitHub Pages Deployment Methods**: Two workflows were attempting to deploy to GitHub Pages using different methods:
   - `docs.yml`: Using modern `actions/deploy-pages@v4` (correct)
   - `ci.yml`: Using legacy `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` (conflicting)

2. **Permission Issues**: The legacy action required different permissions than the modern GitHub Pages deployment method.

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Enhanced docs.yml Workflow Permissions

**File**: `.github/workflows/docs.yml`

**Changes**:

- Added `actions: read` permission to the global permissions
- Added explicit permissions to the deploy job:

  ```yaml
  permissions:
    pages: write
    id-token: write
  ```

### 2. Removed Conflicting Deployment from ci.yml

**File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Changes**:

- Removed the conflicting `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` deployment step
- Kept documentation generation but removed deployment
- Added comment explaining that deployment is handled by `docs.yml`

## Technical Details

### Modern GitHub Pages Deployment (docs.yml)

- Uses `actions/configure-pages@v4` for setup
- Uses `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3` for artifact upload
- Uses `actions/deploy-pages@v4` for deployment
- Requires `pages: write` and `id-token: write` permissions
- Works with GitHub's new Pages deployment method

### Legacy Method (removed from ci.yml)

- Used `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3`
- Required `GITHUB_TOKEN` with different permissions
- Could conflict with modern deployment method

## Workflow Structure

### docs.yml (Primary Documentation Workflow)

1. **Triggers**: Push to main, pull requests, manual dispatch
2. **Jobs**:
   - `build-docs`: Generates documentation for all languages
   - `deploy`: Deploys to GitHub Pages using modern method
   - `check-docs`: Quality checks for documentation

### ci.yml (Continuous Integration)

1. **Triggers**: Push, pull requests
2. **Jobs**: Testing, security audit, publishing, documentation generation (no deployment)

## Expected Results

- ✅ Documentation workflow should complete successfully
- ✅ GitHub Pages should deploy without permission errors
- ✅ No conflicts between different deployment methods
- ✅ Unified documentation site available at GitHub Pages URL

## Verification Steps

1. Push changes to trigger the documentation workflow
2. Check GitHub Actions tab for successful completion
3. Verify GitHub Pages deployment in repository settings
4. Access the documentation site to confirm proper generation

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the next workflow run for successful completion
2. Verify that all documentation (JS, Go, Rust) is properly generated
3. Test the unified documentation site functionality
4. Consider adding workflow status badges to README

## Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/docs.yml`: Enhanced permissions and deployment configuration
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Removed conflicting GitHub Pages deployment
- `DOCUMENTATION_WORKFLOW_FIXES.md`: This summary document

## Additional Notes

- The modern GitHub Pages deployment method is more secure and reliable
- Separating documentation deployment from CI workflow improves maintainability
- The unified documentation site provides a better user experience

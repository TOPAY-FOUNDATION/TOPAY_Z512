# Project Idea: topayz512

**Overview:**
Develop a multi-language, open-source 512-bit post-quantum cryptography library—`topayz512`—with implementations in Rust, Go, and JavaScript/TypeScript. This library will provide a standardized KEM based on LWE, optimized through fragmentation for mobile and embedded devices.

**Key Objectives:**

1. **Security:** Achieve ≥512-bit classical security (\~256-bit quantum resistance) using lattice-based LWE parameters.
2. **Performance:** Fragment large operations into smaller workloads to support high throughput on desktops and acceptable latency on smartphones.
3. **Interoperability:** Expose consistent APIs in Rust, Go, and JS/TS with shared test vectors and documentation.
4. **Adoption:** Package each implementation for easy integration (crates.io, Go modules, npm) and maintain a unified monorepo for coordination.

## How We Can Work Together

1. **Repository Setup**

   * Create the `topayz512/` monorepo with root folders: `rust/`, `go/`, `js/`, `docs/`, `ci/`, `test-vectors/`.
   * Add LICENSE and README at root.

2. **Design & Specification**

   * Finalize `(N, Q, σ)` parameters in `docs/design_spec.md`.
   * Agree on API signatures in `docs/api_reference.md`.

3. **Implementation Phases**
   **Phase A – Core Algorithm**

   * Fork reference LWE project (e.g., FrodoKEM).
   * Implement `keygen`, `encapsulate`, `decapsulate` in Rust (`rust/src/`).
   * Write and publish canonical test vectors to `test-vectors/`.

   **Phase B – Fragmentation & Optimization**

   * Add `fragment.rs` logic in Rust and equivalent in Go/JS.
   * Benchmark performance; target <50 ms mobile.

   **Phase C – Multi-language SDKs**

   * Port core routines to Go (`go/pkg/topayz512/`).
   * Port to JS/TS (`js/src/`).
   * Ensure all platforms pass common test vectors.

4. **Testing & CI**

   * Configure GitHub Actions: `ci/rust.yml`, `ci/go.yml`, `ci/js.yml`.
   * Automate build, test, fuzz, and benchmarks for each language.

5. **Documentation & Examples**

   * Populate `docs/` with usage guides.
   * Add `examples/` in each folder showing file encryption, key exchange.

6. **Release & Community**

   * Tag v1.0.0 when Rust implementation is stable.
   * Publish Rust crate, Go module, and npm package.
   * Announce on relevant forums; invite audits and contributions.

## Communication & Collaboration

* **Issue Tracking:** Use GitHub issues for tasks, feature requests, and bugs.
* **Milestones:** Align with phases A, B, C in GitHub milestones.
* **Meetings:** Weekly syncs via Slack/Discord to discuss progress and blockers.
* **Review Process:** Pull requests must include tests against `test-vectors/` and pass CI.

---

## Community & Governance

* **Community Bonding:** Establish a contributor agreement and code of conduct.
* **Governance Model:** Adopt a governance model like Apache Software Foundation.
* **Release Cadence:** Bi-annual releases, aligning with Rust's cadence.

## Conclusion

By working together, we can create a reliable, high-performing, and user-friendly 512-bit post-quantum cryptography library. Your expertise, time, and resources are valuable in this project.

TOPAY Foundation Pitch Deck
Version: 1.1 (Security Enhanced, July 2025)
1. Welcome to TOPAY
Imagine a world where your money moves instantly and securely, where a simple mistake—sending funds
to the wrong address—can be undone, and where quantum computers no longer threaten your savings.
TOPAY Foundation is building a blockchain ecosystem that’s fast, transparent, quantum-safe, and humancentered.
2. Why Change Is Overdue
Quantum Risk: Classical cryptography (ECC) is vulnerable to future quantum attacks.
Hidden Fees: Users face unpredictable charges and long waits for confirmations.
Irreversible Errors: No safety net for mistaken transfers.
Enterprise Friction: Lack of seamless crypto-native payment rails.
3. Our Human-Centered Solution
Quantum-Resistant Security: Custom 510‑bit lattice encryption to withstand quantum threats.
Reversible Transactions: Community-driven rollback feature to correct mistakes.
Transparent, Fair Fees: Small, fixed percentage fees visible on-chain.
Fragmented-Block Architecture: Parallel fragments allow devices from smartphones to IoT to keep
up.
Developer-Friendly SDK: One-line integration for payments, refunds, and real-time monitoring.
4. Security & Consensus (NEW)
Proof-of-Stake (PoS) + BFT Consensus: Validators must stake TPY tokens and participate in
supermajority voting to finalize new blocks—ensuring network integrity, instant finality, and slashing
of dishonest actors.
Quantum-Safe by Design: All signatures and validator votes use lattice-based encryption for
resilience against quantum attacks.
Economic Penalties for Bad Actors: Slashing and governance allow rapid removal of malicious
validators, protecting users and the network.
5. Real-World Impact
40% Higher Throughput: Parallel fragments deliver faster settlements than legacy chains.
15-Minute Error Recovery: Pilot reversed a 100 TPY mistake in under 15 minutes.
50% Dev Time Saved: Partners cut payment integration time in half with our SDK.
